### First part
[reproduction.ipynb](praktikum/reproduction.ipynb) contains the reproduction of the the __empirical results__ from the paper. The experiments aim at showing that RFMs are able to learn extremely similar features to those learned by neural networks. The reproduction focuses on 3 experiments:
1. __Key result__: RFMs and neural networks learn similar features
2. __Tabular data__: RFMs outperforms most models on tabular data
3. __Special phenomena__: Neural networks and RFMs exhibit grokking and simplicity bias

### Second part
[extensions.ipynb](praktikum/extensions.ipynb) contains some proposed extensions or new experiments.
